2. share both google sheet and drive folder with **datasyncer@syncforsimulated.iam.gserviceaccount.com**
<button onclick="copyText('datasyncer@syncforsimulated.iam.gserviceaccount.com')">
copy
</button>
    <script>
        function copyText(str) {
            navigator.clipboard.writeText(str);
        }
    </script>
